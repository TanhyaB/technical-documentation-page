                As the old saying goes: “Write what you know.” Every technical
                writing project starts with research. It might sound obvious,
                but knowing the purpose and scope of your technical documentation
                beforehand will save you a ton of time and energy (and headaches).
                If you’re not the subject matter expert, this might mean doing some
                internal interviews and building relationships with the technical
                team to get a stronger grasp on the material (and to avoid what
                senior technical writer Will Kelly calls “Mission Impossible” technical
                writing projects). Or, it might be as simple as going through existing
                resources and guides and doing a short audit of what you have and what’s missing.
                All of this information goes in what’s called a documentation plan—a short
                outline to help guide you through the project. Here’s what you should include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Goals: Simply put, what do you want people to be able to do? Is it to use your
                    product? Find help documents quickly and easily? Learn how to use certain
                    aspects
                    of your tool? Let teammates request resources or order fulfillment? Having and
                    knowing a clear goal is essential to writing good technical documentation and
                    will help inform everything you do.
                </li>
                <li>Existing resources: What’s currently out there? Are you updating or merging
                    current resources or starting from scratch? Are there old, outdated versions
                    that need to be killed? Do a quick audit and find anything and everything that
                    will help you write or confuse your audience if they find it.
                </li>
                <li>Style guides: Some industries require you to write technical documentation in a
                    specific way (like the Plain Language guidelines for government sites or
                    Simplified Technical English for aerospace, aviation, or defense companies).
                    In other cases, your company might have a style guide that explains what
                    language
                    to use, how to talk to users, and even grammatical styles.
                </li>
                <li>Outline of topics: What topics and subtopics will you be covering in your
                    technical documentation? Think of this as a table of contents and try to list
                    out every major section and subsection you think you’ll need.
                </li>
                <li>Tools and management: What software, tools, or websites will be used to create
                    and manage the documentation? Link to relevant style guides.
                </li>
                <li>Deadline and final deliverables: When is it due and what format will it be in?
                    Technical documentation is as much about structure and delivery as it is
                    content.
                    And knowing how the content will be presented before you start will tell you
                    what
                    you need and where to put your efforts.

            <header>Step 2: Structure and design</header>
            <p>
                <code></code>
                The goal of any technical documentation is to be usable. And a huge part of that is
                making it structurally logical and easy to navigate. Before you even get into
                creating
                content, you need to think about how that content is going to be presented.
                This means thinking about both on page design (how the individual technical
                documents
                look, what’s included in them, and the hierarchy of information) as well as the
                navigational structure of your document (what order is information presented in,
                how do users move around and navigate, what documents are linked or connected,
                etc...)
                Here are a few quick tips for each:
            </p>

            <header>Use templates or “schemas” for consistent on-page design</header>
            <p>
                Have you ever flipped through a user manual or opened a help document and instantly
                knew it was bad? Most likely this wasn’t due to lack of information, but poor
                structure.
                The human brain has a thing called cognitive fluency, which refers to how easily
                we’re able
                to understand the information placed in front of us. If it’s hard to read
                (through poor design and layout) we experience the content as difficult or less
                useful.
                That’s why technical documentation is structured content. In order to be useful,
                it needs to be presented in a way that’s easy to parse quickly and find what you
                need.
                In most cases, this means using some sort of template or schema
                (a blueprint of how your data will be constructed). For example, your technical
                documentation template might look something like this:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Title: What is it?</li>
                <li>Subtitle: Additional information</li>
                <li>Overview: What will you learn</li>
                <li>Table of contents: Internal navigation</li>
                <li>Features: Each section of the document</li>
                <li>Read next: Related documents that might help the user</li>
            </ul>

            <header>Create a simple, logical navigation structure</header>
            <p>
                Your project as a whole also needs to be organized in a way that makes sense and
                can be quickly parsed. What are the main topics that people will be searching for?
                Under each of those, what specific questions or documents will they be looking for?
                Hierarchy is incredibly important here, which is why Planio’s wiki lets you define
                your own structure and create parent-child relationships.

                Alright! With your documentation plan and structure in place, it’s time to get
                serious about creating your technical documents. Like any writing project, the
                easiest way to create technical documentation is to follow a few steps rather than
                try to dive right in and start writing. Here’s the easiest way to make sure what
                you’re creating is useful, valuable, and clear:
            </p>

            <header>Start with a draft</header>
            <p>
                Using the information in your documentation plan, you can start to sketch out a
                high-level outline for each of the topics you’ll be covering. This is a great place
                to find holes in your planning and research as they’ll become painfully obvious as
                you start to create an outline.
                Once you’ve finished the outline, gather the rest of the specific content you’ll
                need for each topic and any supporting graphics. If you get stuck along the way,
                leave a placeholder or internal note to come back and fill it out.
                Also, if you’re writing a “how to” or help guide, you should follow along and do a
                self-review to make sure everything you’re writing can be done. Always remember
                that your technical documentation is for the user. If they can’t easily navigate,
                read, and use what you’re creating, it’s useless.
            </p>

            <header>A few quick tips on writing well:</header>
            <p>
                Writing doesn’t come naturally to everyone. Especially when the subject matter is
                dense, technical, or complicated. But because your ultimate goal is clarity, you’ll
                want to follow a few simple rules:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Write like a human: Use simple, clear language whenever possible. We’ve all
                    read those documents that sound like Google Translate gone wrong. If you
                    find yourself slipping into awkward sentences or complicated language, step
                    away for a few minutes. Sometimes coming back to a piece of writing after a
                    short break is all it takes to refresh your mind.
                </li>
                <li>Remember, your readers aren’t you: The golden commandment of technical
                    writing is thou shalt not assume. You might think you’re being obvious, but
                    you have to be keenly aware of the knowledge level your audience is at.
                    Don’t assume they know even half as much as you.
                </li>
                <li>Write as much as needed to be helpful and not a word more: Short writing is
                    good writing. Use formatting to break up large chunks of text and keep
                    clarity front and center. As Amazon technical writer Tom Johnson writes: “A
                    good technical writer reduces the word count to just the right brevity
                    without being obscure.”
                </li>
                <li>Remember the power of visuals: It’s another cliche, but pictures really do
                    say a thousand words. Whenever possible, visualize what you’re saying rather
                    than try to explain it.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <header>Use the 30/90 rule to get feedback</header>
            <p>
                Along the way, you’ll want to get feedback on your technical documents, both as a
                gut check to make sure you’re not getting overly complicated as well as to ensure
                you’re explaining things properly.
                Unless you’re an expert in the topic you’re writing about, it’s a good idea to have
                a subject matter expert (SME) come in after the first draft and final draft to
                review.
                Giving feedback is a skill in itself. And when it comes to technical documentation,
                one of the best ways to frame it is as what Jason Freedman calls “30/90 feedback”.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code></code>
                At 30% done (your first draft or outline), you’re not asking for in-depth feedback
                or reviewing or typos and grammar, but rather for the reviewer to engage in the
                broader outline, flow, and structure of the document. While at 90% done (your final
                draft),
                you’re asking them to go over the documentation with a fine-tooth comb and nit-pick
                any issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building in a steady schedule of reviews will make sure you don’t have any nasty
                surprises when you go to submit your final documentation.
            </p>

            <header>Get peer reviews and make revisions</header>
            <p>
                In between reviews from the SME you’ll also want to set up peer-review sessions to
                make sure the content is accessible and usable to your intended audience. Ask a
                project stakeholder or someone outside the project to go over your documents and
                pick out anywhere they get lost or confused.
                It can be disheartening to hear that someone doesn’t understand what you wrote.
                But always remember to keep the user front of mind. If someone within your company
                got lost following your directions, a total outsider doesn’t have a chance.
            </p>

            <header>Edit, edit, and edit some more</header>
            <p>
                Good writing comes down to editing. With your feedback and revisions in place,
                break out your style guides and either edit the documentation yourself or take it
                to a technical editor who can make sure the language has a logical flow and is
                consistent throughout. Whenever possible, you should try to get a second set of
                eyes on your content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Planio wikis are especially powerful for editing with version control, history,
                and roles and permissions to make sure you and your team stay on top of who's
                written
                and edited what.

            <header>Step 4: Deliver and test</header>
            <code></code>
            <p>
                Once your documentation is put together and live, it’s time to get some real-world
                feedback on it. Unfortunately, this step often gets skipped during the development
                of
                technical documents (as most companies don’t have the time and resources or think
                it’s
                not worth it). But, as we’ve said multiple times in this guide already, technical
                documentation is all about the user. If it doesn’t work for them, it’s a failure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start with a simple safety check. This means going through any documents,
                directions,
                or use cases that could potentially cause someone’s computer harm if done
                improperly.
                This could mean exposure of personal data, deleting of important information, etc…
                You’ll know best based on your product.
            </p>
            <p>
                <code></code>
                As part of the safety check, you should make sure to revisit the topics on basic
                functionality and terms explained as these are the core of your documents and should
                be precise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, do a navigation audit. Remember that your document structure is key. If users
                can’t
                get around them easily they’re just as useless. Check for broken links and make sure
                navigational elements are working and obvious (if you don’t have any, you’ll
                probably
                want to add some).
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, check for usability/UX issues. Are users getting lost or confused? Are they
                not
                getting the answers they were looking for (or thought they were getting based on
                headlines or navigation?)
                The experience for the user comes down to more than just what you’ve written.
                Take the time to work with outside testers to make sure that when real users come to
                your documents, they leave happy.

            <p>
                At this point, you’re ready to push your documentation out into the world. But if
                you
                think your job is finished, think again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Technical documentation is living content that needs to be reviewed and brought
                up-to-date with new product releases or updates. As part of your job, you need to
                create a schedule for regular maintenance (go through the test phases again) and
                updates.

            <header>The 4 additional qualities of great technical documentation</header>
            <p>
                If it’s not clear by now, the one thing your technical documentation has to have is
                clarity.
                Ease-of-use is your top priority. But it isn’t your only one. As you put together
                your
                technical documentation, aim for these 4 other qualities:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Efficiency in development and use: Duplicated content, unorganized structures,
                    and
                    unclear processes can kill technical documentation. Use a tool like Planio’s
                    wikis
                    to keep content organized and efficient.
                </li>
                <li>Up-to-date information: There’s no point in giving your users inaccurate
                    information
                    or showing them dated screenshots that don’t look like what they’re dealing
                    with.
                    Keep your technical documentation up-to-date and current.
                </li>
                <li>Consistent design and structure: Every time you get in contact with your users
                    is a
                    time to build your brand. Keep consistent with your design, style, and tone
                    across
                    all online documentation.
                </li>
                <li> Accessible anywhere: Mobile is taking over the world. Your technical
                    documentation,
                    just like the rest of your website or app, needs to be responsive and provide a
                    great
                    experience for users on all devices.

                <li>It’s easy to downplay the role technical documentation plays in your company’s
                    success. But the truth is that the easier it is for a user to find the
                    information
                    they need to use your product, the more they’re going to enjoy it, stay loyal to
                    your brand, and recommend you to other people.
                </li>
                <li>Technical documentation is more than just another task to be checked off your
                    list.
                    It’s an essential part of supporting the people that support you. So take the
                    time
                    to follow this guide, create a clear, accurate structure, and write content that
                    turns your users into product superheroes.
